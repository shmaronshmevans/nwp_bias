    Calculate the error between NWP model data and NYSM data for a specific target variable.

    Args:
        target (str): The target variable name (e.g., 't2m' for temperature).
        station (str): The station identifier for which data is being compared.
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame containing NWP and NYSM data.

    Returns:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame with the 'target_error' column added.

    This function calculates the error between the NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) modeldata and NYSM (New York State Mesonet) data for a specific target variable at a given station. The error is computed by subtracting the NYSM data from the NWP model data.
